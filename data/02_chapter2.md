## CHAPTER 2 How science pursues its aims

### 2.1 PUBLIC HEALTH AND HOW VALUES SHAPE SCIENCE

After reading this section, you should be able to:

- Define biological sex and gender and say how each might be relevant to health outcomes
- Describe the germ theory of disease and social determinates of health, saying what is important about each focus in health research
- Describe how social values influence scientific research aims

#### Covid-19 and social determinates of disease

Covid‐19 was declared to be a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March of 2020. So early in the pandemic, little was known about the illness. Scientists very quickly identified the virus responsible, dubbed SARS‐CoV‐2. But how it was transmitted, what influenced people’s vulnerability to the illness, and how the pan‐demic would progress remained a mystery for some time.

Studies based on early reports out of Wuhan, China, concluded that men were more than twice as likely as women to die from Covid‐19. Other studies corroborated that men were much more likely to be admitted to intensive care units and to die from the illness. Early investigations of this phenomenon tended to target biological sex as the relevant factor, focusing on immune system differences between males and females due to hormonal balance and genes on the X and Y chromosomes. One study proposed that a “sex‐based approach” to treating Covid‐19 should be developed, with different medical support for male and female patients.

Biological sex includes the categories male, female, and intersex (perhaps with multiple varieties), which in humans is determined by combinations of X and Y chromosomes, hormones, reproductive organs, and other physical traits. The distinct but related term gender includes behaviors, social roles, appearances, and identities of individuals traditionally associated with the expression of masculinity, femininity, or non‐binary features. A broader range of gender identities are acknowledged today, and some challenge the very idea of gender categories. Here, what’s relevant are the behaviors and social roles related to genders traditionally associated with biological sex categories—that is, being a man or being a woman.

Biological sex and gender are distinct variables in health research, but which is relevant can be difficult to discern in some cases. Although biological sex is physiological and gender is behavioral and social, gender can still have physiological effects, including health effects. For instance, if men are more likely to continue to work outside the home during a pandemic stay-at-home order due to gender differences across occupations (a social role) or more likely to resist health recommendations like masking (a behavioral tendency), then this could result in increased susceptibility to Covid-19. If men are more likely to neglect preventive healthcare and treatment of health conditions (a behavioral tendency), then this could result in worse outcomes when they contract Covid-19. If it’s unknown whether sex or gender differences are responsible for some health disparity, researchers might just refer to “sex/gender.”

In light of the emerging focus on different Covid outcomes for men and women, a group of scientists and science scholars at Harvard University’s GenderSci Lab began to comprehensively track sex/gender disparities in Covid-19 outcomes across the United States. These researchers found that the sex/gender differences in Covid outcomes changed over time, across different states, and in different social contexts such as urban and rural areas. This pattern suggested it was not biological differences between sexes but social/behavioral differences between men and women that were primarily responsible for the observed variation in Covid outcomes. This is because typical behaviors and social roles vary across locations and incidental circumstances in a way that the sex differences between males and females (chromosomes, hormones, and reproductive organs) do not. On average and in ways that vary across time and place, men and women tend to have different careers, different likelihoods of smoking cigarettes, different relationships to preventive care and health precautions, and more—all of which can influence one’s susceptibility to Covid-19 and its severity if one does contract it.

And so, what had initially appeared to be a physiological difference in susceptibility to Covid-19 related to biological sex was revealed by further research to be instead—at least in large part—a social difference in exposure and vulnerability related to gender.

This difference is important for researchers to understand. In health research, biological factors like genes and hormones associated with biological sex tend to receive more attention than social factors like lifestyle choices and healthcare access. This can lead healthcare to focus too much on biological factors and neglect social factors. Recall, for example, the study mentioned earlier that suggested the need for different medical treatments for Covid-19 in men and women due to presumed immune system differences. That study did not consider whether social factors might instead be responsible for the sex/gender disparity in Covid-19. This focus on biological sex in health research and healthcare and the neglect of social factors related to gender can in turn reinforce stereotypes about differences between men and women tracing back to biological sex differences. It’s hard to learn about the significance of social factors related to gender if they aren’t investigated in research.

Note that similar points apply to health impacts of race. Health research has tended to emphasize physiological differences related on average to race, such as prevalence of certain genes or genetic conditions or susceptibility to conditions like heart disease or osteoporosis. But race is a social category, associated with social factors that have clear implications for health, such as average socioeconomic status, access to health‐care, exposure to racism and other sources of stress, and exposure to environmental hazards (like proximity of a neighborhood to polluting industries). As with gender and biological sex, if health research does not attend to race as a social factor, it risks essentializing race as only a biological factor. In the Covid‐19 pandemic, racial and ethnic minorities in the United States suffered higher rates of infection and death from Covid‐19 due in large part to social factors like living conditions, type of work, and access to healthcare.

There is a broader point behind these stories about Covid‐19’s variable impact by gender and race. Historically, health research and health campaigns largely focused on social influences on health: better sanitation, less crowded housing, safer work conditions, and neighborhood improvements. In the late 19th century, microbes were discovered: bacteria, viruses, and fungi so tiny they are invisible were found to be the source of many diseases. The germ theory of disease, the theory that such microbes, or “germs,” cause illnesses, won out over the miasma theory, which held that illnesses are caused by bad air from rotting matter and other bad sources. This led health research and campaigns to narrow their focus to preventing the transmission of germs and infection from germs, as with antibiotics and vaccination.

Yet there was also something right about the earlier health focus on living conditions. As we’ve illustrated with Covid‐19, various social factors are relevant to disease susceptibility and severity: education, income, housing conditions and exposure to pollution, pervasive stress from racism, access to healthy food and activities, and more. These are collectively referred to as social determinants of health.

Over the past century or so, a focus on interventions related to germs, like avoiding and slowing disease transmission and developing vaccines and antibiotics, has predominated over research and interventions related to the social determinates of health. 

#### Social values and the aims of health research

 The health sciences include a variety of fields, two of which are medicine and public health. Medical research and practice focus on preventative and treatment options for individuals with, or at risk of, particular health conditions. Medicine primarily draws on the biological sciences, as reflected in the common term *biomedical science*. In contrast, public health research and practice focus on the overall health of populations, primarily in disease prevention, drawing from research in social sciences, psychology, and environmental science.

The field of public health is where social determinates of health are most likely to be investigated. But even public health has been shaped by the germ theory of disease to focus especially on disease transmission, to the extent that social determinates of health have been pushed to the side. Social determinates of health, like housing conditions, exposure to pollution, access to healthy food, and more, can be less obvious in their importance and can be challenging to address. But, for many diseases, addressing social determinates of health is crucial to supporting a healthier population. This is especially so for so-called lifestyle diseases that aren’t caused by pathogens directly but rather things like diet, exercise, smoking, and drug and alcohol use. Examples of lifestyle diseases are heart disease, stroke, type II diabetes, and some forms of cancer. In many nations, lifestyle diseases are among the most common causes of death.

Focusing too much on the role of germs in diseases—a medical view of disease—can make for a sicker population by leading to the neglect and misunderstanding of the social determinates of communicable diseases, like Covid-19, and to the relative neglect of lifestyle diseases. In some articles in the popular magazine *The Atlantic*, science writer Ed Yong has suggested that the Covid-19 pandemic, including its inequities along race and gender lines, is an opportunity to refocus public health on the social determinates of disease.

Covid‐19 is a good illustration of how scientific research could focus on many different but related topics. Scientific research on Covid‐19 ranges from the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus’s structure and impact on specific cells; to the epidemiology of how quickly the disease would spread, how it would impact the economy, and how spread would change with different public health actions, like stay‐at‐home orders; to the influences of age, class, gender, and race, as described earlier; and more. And, of course, Covid‐19 is just one threat to public health. There are also many other health topics in need of study, in general and even in how the pandemic influenced them. For the pandemic, these include mental health and educational impacts of stay‐at‐home orders and school closures; the effects of postponed care on health conditions like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes; how social distancing influenced the transmission of seasonal illnesses like the flu; and more. And this only scratches the surface of the range of potential health research topics in general, of course.

So, which of these many research topics should be prioritized in health research? And should the focus be on medical treatment, preventative and population health, or something else? The answers to these questions are influenced by social values of the communities that influence science. Social values are group priorities and moral ideas accepted in a community. Social values provide a shared background orientation that can influence decisions and activities, including in scientific research. But social values are not universally shared: different communities might have other social values or differently prioritize some of the same social values.

Here’s an example related to our case study of how Covid‐19 impacts different genders. Harvard University’s GenderSci Lab, the group that tracked sex and gender disparities in Covid‐19 outcomes, describes itself on its website as “dedicated to generating feminist concepts, methods and theories for scientific research on sex and gender.” This group brings their shared feminist values to their biomedical research, including bringing a critical perspective to research that may emphasize sex differences more than the data warrant. This perspective leads to research that can shed light on how gender influences health outcomes.

As this example shows, social values influence which research topics are priorities in health research. Other examples include whether attention should focus more on medical options for difficult‐to‐treat diseases or on broad health outcomes in the overall population, including those with less access to medical care, and whether attention should focus more on theoretical knowledge of some disease, be it Covid‐19 or cancer, or prevention of the most cases possible. Different orientations on these and other questions will shift which research topics are prioritized and what the focus is in researching any given topic. This helps make sense of Ed Yong’s suggestion that attention to social injustice and health inequity arising out of Covid‐19 may motivate additional investment in public health research and a greater focus on the social determinates of health within the field of public health.

The influence of social values on research topics and aims is not special to health science but is general across science. Incredibly important questions to ask to understand science, then, are these: What is the specific research topic and aim? And what are the reasons for prioritizing those topics and aims over others?

In Chapter 1, we suggested that science is ultimately structured to pursue knowledge about our world: natural explanations of natural phenomena. Here, we’ve seen how that general aim can vary widely in the specifics, and social values help drive which specific aims and topics are prioritized over others. The remainder of this chapter is devoted to an overview of the methods science employs to pursue these aims and how the institution of science developed to support them.

### 2.2 VARIETY OF SCIENTIFIC AIMS AND METHODS

After reading this section, you should be able to:

- Identify why there is not a single, unified scientific method
- Explain how different scientific aims and circumstances influence scientific methods
- Characterize the roles of the following in science: experiments and observational studies, modeling, scientific arguments, statistical reasoning, and theorizing

---

### No simple scientific method

In some science class along the way, you probably learned about the scientific method. But, interpreted literally, the idea that science always uses the scientific method is a myth. There is no fixed series of steps that scientific research follows. There is immense variability in aims and in methods for getting there, and there is considerable room for creativity along the way.

In Chapter 1, we developed a checklist approach to defining science. That checklist focused a lot on methods common in science, like empirical investigation, evidence gathering, openness to criticism, and collaboration. Scientific methods are central to its ability to produce trustworthy knowledge about our world. But the reason we defined science with a checklist is because of all the variety scientific projects can have, and that includes variety in methods.

Some of the most important scientific breakthroughs had decidedly unscientific-seeming origins. For example, there was no real method by which 19th-century German chemist August Kekulé discovered that the benzene molecule was structured like a ring; allegedly, he just had a daydream of a snake biting its tail. (However, this daydream came after Kekulé had been studying chemistry and the nature of carbon-carbon bonds for years.) Similarly, the idea that natural selection is the mechanism of evolutionary change occurred to the British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace during a feverish attack of malaria while traveling in Indonesia in 1858—or so he wrote in his autobiography.

We also saw in section 2.1 how scientific research can have a number of different aims—generating knowledge, supporting effective action, making predictions, designing and building new products and technologies—and can focus on a number of different topics. For example, we encountered the different health conditions medical science and public health may prioritize, as well as whether the focus is on theoretical understanding, medical treatment, prevention efforts, or something else.

Scientific methods are sometimes represented very simply, but there are many variations in science’s aims and methods. So, there is no clear method supporting at least some important scientific discoveries, and there’s lots of variation in the aims of scientific research. You might think that once an aim is decided on and then a hypothesis is formulated, the scientific method kicks into gear in how the hypothesis is tested. But there are also many differences in how and the degree to which scientific claims are tested by empirical evidence. Sometimes empirical investigation is exploratory and open‐ended, without clear ideas in mind to test. Sometimes getting direct empirical evidence for or against an idea isn’t possible, and scientists must be creative in how they find evidence or what they count as evidence. Sometimes the research doesn’t involve collecting new empirical evidence at all but combining or reinterpreting existing evidence. These and other complications are reasons to say that there is no single thing we can call “the” scientific method.

##### Box 2.1 Descriptive versus normative claims in science

Descriptive claims are claims about how things are. Examples of descriptive claims are that this textbook has three authors and that the Nile River flows over 6,600 kilometers. Descriptive claims can be evaluated for their truth or falsity. “Rabat is the capital of Australia” is a false descriptive claim. In contrast, normative claims are claims about how things should be. For example, people should read more; scientists should be sincere; there ought to be peace. These claims can be evaluated for the robustness of the rules that they specify. Descriptive and normative considerations are both part of science. Certain theories in economics, for example, make claims about rational decision-making, which express how agents should make decisions. If people do not make decisions that way, it does not follow that the theory is false—though economists, depending on their goals, might revise their normative theories to make them more descriptively accurate. Just as science involves both normative and descriptive claims, both kinds of claims can be made about science. One can simply attempt to characterize what science is—that is, how scientists in fact develop theories and test claims.

Metascience, using scientific techniques to study science itself, is a discipline that pursues this route. Or, one can attempt to say how science should work, that is, what features science should have for it to succeed at generating knowledge. Philosophy of science sometimes pursues this route. This book does both.

#### Different methods for different aims and circumstances

Let’s add more detail to the idea of a variety of scientific aims introduced in section 2.1. First off, that variety of aims regards what natural phenomenon is studied—such as in the case of health sciences, Covid‐19, heart disease, and environmental pollution, to name just a few options. This variety of aims also regards what specific aspects of the phenomena are investigated. An illustration of this is

##### Table 2.2 The variety of scientific aims

| Types OF VARIETY               | Examples                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|                                |                                                              |
| Phenomenon studied             | Covid-19, heart disease, or environmental pollution          |
| Focal aspect of the phenomenon | Structure and biological action of SARS-CoV-2, epidemiological models of disease spread, or how virus affects different genders and races |
| Goal of the research           | Specific theoretical knowledge, connections to knowledge of other phenomena, medical treatment, prediction, or public policy guidance |

All the different aspects of Covid‐19 that were investigated by different scientists, such as the structure and biological action of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus, epidemiological models of disease spread, and how the virus affected people of different genders and races differently.

The variety of scientific aims also extends to the specific research goals when targeting some aspect of some phenomenon. Is the focus of studying the structure and biological action of SARS‐CoV‐2, for example, to develop theoretical knowledge of this virus in particular, or to explore its similarities to other coronaviruses, or to spur vaccine discovery, or to predict how the virus will likely evolve, or to determine what kinds of public policy would mitigate its spread? All of these are reasonable goals for scientific research into this aspect of the phenomenon, but each can lead to research with different features.

Besides having a variety of different aims, scientific research is also carried out in a variety of different circumstances. Some phenomena you can directly influence, while others you can just watch from a distance. Some phenomena you can see with your own eyes, and others you can merely detect distant evidence of. Some phenomena change quickly, and others are very slow. Sometimes scientists have specialized equipment to support exactly what they’re trying to do, and at other times they need to make do with old equipment or no specialized equipment at all. Perhaps the desired equipment hasn’t yet been invented.

These differences in the aims and circumstances of scientific research give rise to differences in scientific methods. A good bit of resourcefulness is needed to find the empirical evidence to support developing natural explanations of natural phenomena. The specific aims and circumstances influence what methods will be useful to that project. Most of the main topics of this book can be thought of as exploring one or another aspect of how scientific methods vary in response to aims and circumstances.

As we’ve already suggested, one major type of variability in methods regards the manner and extent of empirical investigation. Recall from Chapter 1 that empirical investigation is inquiry that grounds the justification for beliefs about the world in sensory information and observations. More empirical evidence that directly bears on ideas under investigation is always better. What varies is, first, how empirical evidence can be gathered and, second, how directly that evidence bears on the ideas being investigated. Experiments are a highly valuable way of conducting empirical investigation. In Chapter 3, we will survey the ways in which experiments are conducted, identifying their core features and also recognizing how different experiments can be from one another.

Sometimes it just isn’t possible to conduct an experiment. When this is the case, there are various ways to conduct observational studies and use other methods to gather empirical evidence bearing on the ideas under investigation. We survey several of those methods in Chapter 4. One valuable set of methods to indirect empirical investigation is scientific modeling; this is the topic of Chapter 5.

We said just a few paragraphs ago that the aims and circumstances of scientific investigation influence the extent to which empirical evidence bears directly on the ideas under investigation. Oftentimes, whether an idea is true can’t be directly determined using empirical investigation. Instead, scientists need to deploy arguments, or reasoning, that use empirical evidence to support conclusions about the ideas they are interested in. This reasoning can follow different patterns. Sometimes it’s what we call deductive reasoning, as when an empirical test provides grounds for definitively rejecting a hypothesis; we examine that pattern of reasoning in Chapter 6. Other times, reasoning patterns in scientific arguments involve drawing general conclusions from a limited set of evidence or, in other ways, reasoning beyond what the evidence guarantees. These forms of reasoning, called inductive and abductive, are discussed in Chapter 7.

A variety of mathematical tools are also put to use in science, though whether and how mathematics is relevant is yet another feature of science that varies. Particularly widespread and important uses of mathematical tools involve reasoning with probabilities, which we discuss in Chapter 8, and using statistics to describe phenomena (Chapter 9) and to make inferences and predictions (Chapter 10). Statistical tools can be used to uncover patterns in what might otherwise seem merely like random variation.

One important aim of scientific research is uncovering causal relationships. Chapter 11 explores how methods encountered in earlier chapters can be used in causal reasoning. Chapter 12 examines how all of the various methods of empirical investigation surveyed throughout the book can be used to develop scientific theories and explanation, important forms of scientific knowledge. Finally, Chapter 13 explores more fully how social values influence scientific practices and surveys salient features of science in the 21st century and new challenges it faces.

By the time we’ve worked through all the topics of this book, we will have seen the great extent of variation in science’s methods and in how these methods relate to the different aims and circumstances of scientific research. But first, let’s take a quick look at some of the commonalities across these methods.

##### Box 2.2 How to read a scientific article

Watch Video 4

Scientific knowledge is typically communicated in articles published in professional journals written by experts, for experts. Thus, scientific articles tend to use specialized jargon, formalism, images, equations, and tables that most people will find hard to understand. For non-experts reading scientific articles, one helpful method involves a set of five questions for structured reading:

1. What problem did the authors try to address? You will typically find the answer to this question in the article’s Abstract and/or Introduction.
2. What’s the point of addressing that problem? To answer this question, focus on the Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion sections.
3. What did the authors do to address their question or problem? The Methods and Results sections should provide you with an answer; but do not get lost in the details—just focus on the independent and dependent variables the researchers manipulated and measured and the general kind of methods they employed.
4. What did the authors find? Focus on the key finding presented in the Results section. This is where the specific research question and rationale are addressed.
5. How are the results interpreted? Read the Discussion section to answer this question, considering whether the authors’ interpretation is warranted by what they did and what they set out to address, and try to figure out if an alternative interpretation of the results may be more warranted.

### 2.3 RECIPES FOR SCIENCE

After reading this section, you should be able to:

- Describe what the metaphor of recipes and ingredients is intended to mean here
- Define each of the three ingredients found in most recipes for science, and describe why each is a challenge
- Describe at least three ways in which each of the ingredients of science—hypotheses, expectations, and observations—can vary

#### Methods in science

In this chapter, we have surveyed how scientific aims and methods vary. Science proceeds in myriad ways, and there’s not a simple, unified scientific method. And yet, as the title of this book suggests, even as scientific methods vary, science does follow some familiar recipes.

Consider culinary recipes like you find in a cookbook. These recipes have some standard components, like the name and origin of the dish, the ingredients along with their quantities and proportions, cooking times, and the necessary equipment to make the dish. These recipes also vary: in their ingredients, the equipment and processes they involve, their difficulty, how long they take, and—of course—what will result from following the recipe. Furthermore, simply following the steps doesn’t guarantee a delicious dish. Many cooks have margin notes in their cookbooks adapting recipes to their circumstances and tastes. And some recipes are just bad recipes!

Like culinary recipes, recipes for science have multiple components, involve a wide array of techniques and instruments, vary from one to another, accomplish different tasks, and are improved by others. As with cooking, there is no single set of mechanical instructions and step-by-step procedures that guarantees good science. Just like great cooking, good science is a highly variable and creative process. It also can be messy.

Still, just as culinary recipes tend to have some common features, recipes for science tend to use some common patterns. To start, most involve something like these three ingredients, in one form or another: hypotheses, expectations, and observations. What is sometimes thought of as “the” scientific method describes one way these ingredients can come together: scientists may formulate hypotheses about the world, described in Chapter 1 as bold and risky conjectures, and then use those hypotheses to generate specific expectations regarding their experiences. If their observations conform to those expectations, their hypotheses are confirmed. If not, they return to the drawing board.

These three ingredients—hypotheses, expectations, observations—can be combined in different orders, and they can be combined again and again in different patterns. And each ingredient can vary in its features. For example, sometimes scientists investigate a specific hypothesis, while at other times research is more exploratory and open-ended. Sometimes hypotheses have obvious empirical implications, and at other times scientists need to use statistics to develop their expectations. Sometimes scientists design experiments to test their expectations, and at other times they develop models. Further, some scientific research isn’t described well by this trio of hypothesis, expectations, observations, such as highly theoretical research carried out without making observations.

Nonetheless, these three ingredients are integral to the production of scientific knowledge. They are the basic ingredients that, with tremendous variation, occur in the many successful recipes for science we survey in this book.

#### Hypotheses

Empirical investigation is how we learn about our world. Scientists make observations to try to figure out what’s out there, why things are the way they are, and how things change. But simple observations can’t accomplish these tasks by themselves; scientists also need theoretical claims.

Theoretical claims are claims made about entities, properties, or occurrences that are not directly observable. As an example, consider a claim about all of something of some kind, like the claim that all salt dissolves in water. You might have seen plenty of salt dissolve in water, but you will never be able to witness all of the salt that exists dissolving in water. Because you can’t directly observe that all salt dissolves in water, this is a theoretical claim. We have plenty of evidence that this is true, but the claim is theoretical because it goes beyond what we can directly observe.

Theoretical claims investigated in science are called hypotheses. A hypothesis is a conjectural statement based on limited data—a guess about what some aspect of the world is like, which is not (yet) backed by sufficient, or perhaps any, evidence. Scientists do not yet know whether any given hypothesis is true or false; when there is sufficient evidence in favor of some hypothesis, it graduates from that category. Theoretical claims that we have sufficient evidence to conclude are true become scientific knowledge.

Formulating a hypothesis requires some imagination: if you could observe something we can’t—if you could witness the beginning of life on Earth, or see all the salt in the world—what would you find? Sometimes scientists may formulate a hypothesis before any observations have been made, just with the use of their imagination. But often, initial observations, other hypotheses, or background knowledge about related phenomena help inspire new hypotheses. Before scientists knew about the properties of potassium chloride, they’d seen that table salt—sodium chloride—dissolves in water. This informed their expectations for potassium chloride, a similar compound. Scientists’ hypotheses about the first lifeforms were shaped by what they know about organisms, existing and extinct, and how the Earth has changed over geologic time.

Scientists can have different levels of confidence in different hypotheses. If a hypothesis is informed by lots of experience with similar objects or significant background knowledge of related phenomena, scientists might be much more confident in it than if it were a random guess. But, by their very nature, hypotheses are guesses. This is why hypotheses must be tested.

#### Expectations

Learning whether a hypothesis is true is often more circuitous than just making direct observations. A second ingredient is usually needed to test hypotheses: this is developing expectations based on hypotheses. Expectations are conjectural claims about observable phenomena based on some hypothesis. These claims are conjectures since they go beyond what scientists have observed so far, but, unlike hypotheses, their truth or falsity can be discerned directly from making the right kind of observations. Expectations are claims about what scientists expect to observe if a given hypothesis is true.

Expectations do not regard just any possible observations, but observations that scientists anticipate being able to make. We could say what we would expect to experience if we were present for the beginning of life on Earth, but since we don’t have a way to make those observations, such expectations are useless. Instead, expectations based on a hypothesis regarding the origin of life on Earth should be about what scientists expect to see today, in present lifeforms or in traces of past life.

Depending on the nature of a hypothesis, developing expectations based on the hypothesis can be straightforward or complicated. On one extreme, the hypothesis that all salt dissolves in water leads directly to an expectation: any sample of salt will dissolve when placed in water. But even then, the expectation needs to be fine-tuned. Should salt dissolve when placed on a chunk of ice (frozen water)? What if some salt is already dissolved in the water; should we still expect the sample of salt to dissolve? And expectations for present observations that bear on some hypothesis about the origins of life on Earth are, of course, much more complicated to develop.

No matter whether deriving expectations is relatively straightforward or very complicated, this is an important and nontrivial ingredient of scientific research. Expectations set scientists up to make observations that can provide evidence for or against the truth of a hypothesis. Deriving expectations thus serves as a bridge between theoretical claims (hypotheses) and observations (data).

#### Observations

All or nearly all science fundamentally depends on observations. It’s not enough to think up interesting ideas about how the world might work; those interesting ideas must also be evaluated by how well they fit with our observations of the world. This is why both empirical investigation and evidentialism are on our checklist definition of science from Chapter 1. Observations include any information gained from your senses—not only what you see, but also what you hear, smell, touch, taste, and any other way you may be able to experience the world.

Your sensory experiences belong only to you. If we are on a hike together, we might both hear a rattling sound coming from behind a boulder. But each of us only has access to our own experience of the sound. Data are different. Data are public records produced by observation, sensory experience, or some measuring device. Observations are important because they are your only way to directly access the world. Data based on observations are important because they allow us to record and compare our observations.

Observation isn’t passive. We can move our heads to see different things and relocate our bodies to different places where we can hear different things. We can also use observations from multiple senses together. If you’re wondering about that rattling sound from behind the boulder, you can walk around to the other side to see whether there’s a rattlesnake there. Besides changing our position and using multiple senses to enhance our observations, we can also change the world around us to create opportunities for different observations. Crushing a leaf lets you better smell whether it’s sage or mint.

Humans have also found many ways to use tools to enhance our powers of observation. Light can be refracted with mirrors, prisms, and lenses to extend the reach of vision. We now can see not just through our eyes alone, but also through our eyes aided by telescopes, microscopes, and other devices. To help us hear beyond our ears’ capabilities, we have developed microphones, stethoscopes, and more. These technological enhancements range from observational correctives like eyeglasses and simple sensory aids like microscopes to much more complex technology with highly specific purposes, like an fMRI machine that can show brain activity and the Large Hadron Collider, which uses superconducting magnets to cause streams of high-energy particles to collide in a detectable way. Such enhancements have allowed humans to generate what we might call super-observational access: using tools to enhance our powers of observation beyond what they ordinarily include.

Making observations, and collecting data as records of those observations, is at the heart of science’s ability to generate knowledge of our world. But observations aren’t always independent from the ideas about the world we already have. Changes in what we believe to be true can have significant impact on what we observe. For instance, when we observe the Sun at the horizon, what we seem to see is the Sun at one point on its path across the sky. Geocentricism, the historically dominant idea that the Earth is the center of the universe, organizes this and similar observations into an easily understood pattern, and those observations confirm geocentrism. But from the perspective of heliocentrism—the idea that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun—once your head is slightly turned to the side, the Sun at the horizon and the other planetary bodies that appear comprise a different observation. Figure 2.4 schematically diagrams this conceptual shift.

The switch in theoretical orientation to heliocentrism thus provides a different perspective on astronomical observations. It may also create a different perceptual experience: instead of the Sun moving below the horizon as it sets, your position on Earth rotates away from the Sun. New ideas can sometimes have a strong effect on what we think we see. Thus, observations are a crucial ingredient of science, but they aren’t passive, aren’t always the starting point, and aren’t always decisive.

#### Science and everyday reasoning

The ingredients of science’s recipes discussed in section 2.3—hypotheses, expectations, and observation—comprise a distinctive and powerful combination that support science’s distinctive ability to generate knowledge about our world. They are also to some extent common strategies employed by people in their everyday lives, as well as strategies harnessed historically by different cultures around the world, to some extent building incrementally toward the modern institution of science.

Alison Gopnik, a psychologist at the University of California at Berkeley, has conducted research exploring ways in which early childhood development involves empirical investigation, much like the research conducted by scientists. Babies and children conduct informal experiments: they test their ideas about the world around them by checking out whether what they observe matches up with what they expect to happen.

Over time, children develop something akin to theories about things that are important to them, including about what other people around them think and believe. These theories grow more sophisticated as children develop, for example, by incorporating the recognition that someone with different experiences from oneself will have different ideas. Around four or five years old, a child begins to recognize, for example, that someone who did not witness a jar of cookies being moved to a new location will have a false belief about where the cookies are, even though the child knows the true location of the cookies.

Much like scientists, children conduct experiments and develop theories as attempts to better understand the world around them. This use of observation to develop theories about the world extends into adulthood, though adults tend to be more confident about what we will encounter and thus more fixed in our ideas. Perhaps, then, scientific research can be thought of in some respects like an extension of childhood curiosity and openness, cultivated into habits of investigation and openness to refutation about the topics a scientist investigates.

The basic pattern of making guesses, collecting observations, and then adjusting ideas in response is common across people of all ages, at least when the circumstances call for it. What is distinctive about science is, first, harnessing this basic pattern to systematically gain knowledge about our world, and, second, developing an institution around this project, including the important social norms introduced in Chapter 1.

#### The development of science as an institution

Science’s aim of producing knowledge traces back to the origins of the very word science. This word derives from the Latin words scientia and scīre, which pertain to knowledge. So, science, from its origins, has been about the pursuit of knowledge.

Most historians of science agree that cultural, social, and technological changes that unfolded in Europe between roughly 1550 and 1750 are very important to the development of the modern institution of science. This period is often referred to as the Scientific Revolution, beginning with the work of Nicolaus Copernicus, who put forward a heliocentric theory of the cosmos, and ending with Isaac Newton, who proposed universal laws of physics and a mechanical universe. The Scientific Revolution brought about fundamental transformations in our knowledge of the natural world and in how knowledge claims were thought to be justified. Many of the methods, ideas, and institutional structures developed during that period remain central to science.

But let’s start our consideration of science’s history even further back. Way before the Scientific Revolution, a variety of innovations across diverse civilizations—including ancient Egypt, Iran, India, China, Greece, and the pre‐Columbian Americas—provided fertile grounds for proto‐scientific activity. A variety of civilizations developed measurement systems that were essential for collecting data and refining ideas about various phenomena. For instance, many ancient civilizations made sophisticated catalogues of constellations and their observed movements in the night sky, which provided a detailed record of data against which later astronomical predictions and discoveries could be checked.

One important period in the development of science prior to the Scientific Revolution was the 500 years from the 8th through 13th centuries known as the Islamic Golden Age, during which time early science saw significant development from Central Asia to the Iberian Peninsula. Here is a sample of some of the scientifically important developments from that period.

The Hindu‐Arabic numeral system, which greatly advanced the symbolic representation of numbers and calculation, was invented between the first and fourth centuries in India. Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al‐Khwārizmī further developed this system in the eighth century and brought it to Arabic mathematics, and his work later introduced this numeral system to medieval Europe. Al‐Khwārizmī also made significant contributions to algebra, geometry, and astronomy. Shortly after, Abū Bakr Muhammad ibn Zakariyyā al‐Rāzī was responsible for many innovations in medicine, including advocating for experimental methods and developing classifications of contagious diseases. In the ninth and tenth centuries, Ibn al‐Haytham conducted revolutionary work in optics and vision, including the discovery that vision occurs by eyes detecting light deflected by objects.

Arabic polymaths, including especially Ibn Sina, known also by the Latinized name Avicenna, ibn Aḥmad Al‐Bīrūnī, and Ibn Rushd, or Averroes, preserved and developed theories about the natural world from the famous fourth‐century BCE philosopher Aristotle. This was the basis of ideas about the natural world in 15th‐century Europe, with ideas added from Christian, Jewish, and Islamic theology. Based on Aristotle’s views, the universe was thought to be geocentric—the Earth at the center—and with two regions: terrestrial for Earth and celestial for the planets and stars. The celestial region was thought to contain transparent concentric spheres that rotate around the Earth. In the first century, Ptolemy supplemented this with an account of the apparent motions of the stars and planetary paths, including detailed models and tables that could be used to calculate the positions of the stars and planets. Geocentrism in 15th‐century Europe blended observations of planetary bodies with religious ideas about humanity’s place in the universe.

A longstanding problem with the geocentric view of the cosmos was the appearance of retrograde motion. In observations made over a series of nights, planets sometimes seem to stop in their orbit, reverse course back across the sky, then stop again, and reverse yet again to continue on their original way. Following Ptolemy, geocentrists explained retrograde motion by positing epicycles: that the planets were on mini‐orbits that also follow the larger orbits. This successfully accounted for retrograde motion, but it wasn’t as intuitive as other elements of geocentrism.

In the 16th century, Nicolaus Copernicus presented a radical alternative conception of the cosmos as heliocentric, or centered on the Sun, and this provided an alternative explanation for retrograde motion. According to heliocentrism, retrograde motion of planets was due to Earth’s changing position relative to other planets as these all revolved around the sun. Copernicus’s proposed heliocentric conception of the cosmos was met with skepticism. It violated widely accepted beliefs and called for a fundamentally new physics of the heavens. Besides, the mathematics of Copernicus’s system was just as complex as Ptolemy’s epicycle solution to retrograde motion, and it did not   make predictions of planetary motion any more accurate. So, few astronomers were convinced by Copernicus’s theory.

The situation changed with the research of Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei, each of whom developed and improved the Copernican heliocentric system. Kepler was a German mathematician and astronomer with interest also in astrology; he devised a set of laws that described the motions of planets around the Sun. Based on calculations of the orbits of Mars, he inferred that planets do not have circular orbits as proposed by Copernicus but ellipses instead. This simplified the Copernican theory and significantly improved the predictive accuracy of heliocentric models. Born in Italy, Galileo was instrumental in establishing Copernicus’s heliocentric system and, more generally, in replacing Aristotelian mechanics of the separate terrestrial and celestial realms with a new, single physics. Galileo invented the telescope, which he used to observe the phases of Venus and to discover that Jupiter had moons orbiting it. This was a significant discovery for heliocentrism: if our Earth were the center of the cosmos around which all things orbit, then Jupiter’s moons should be orbiting Earth instead.

In the Scientific Revolution, the rapid development of new ideas, methods, and tools resulted in the swift accumulation of knowledge. A similar process played out in the later development of the fields of chemistry, biology, psychology, and economics. But many of the pursuits that furthered scientific knowledge also included religious, theological, and philosophical ideas that we would not consider scientific nowadays. In the Islamic Golden Age and the Scientific Revolution, philosophy, theology, and science were not divided as they are now, and often the same ideas had significance for religious belief and views about the natural world. The Scientific Revolution was a decisive step toward the separation of scientific from nonscientific questions and thus toward science explicitly adopting naturalism.

Other central features of the nature of science were also established in the Islamic Golden Age and the Scientific Revolution, such as looking to sense experience and performing experiments to decide what’s true, the systematic use of mathematics to study natural phenomena, and the institutionalization of investigation in formal organizations. Of course, these features have also continued to develop since those times. For example, the social organization of scientific activity was significantly transformed. with the professionalization of science in Europe and North America beginning in the mid‐19th century, which also established the French language, and later English, as the dominant language for scientific communication.

#### Institutional science and indigenous knowledge

This picture of scientific revolutions culminating in the development of contemporary science is helpful for demonstrating how science is a development shaped by various human societies, but it has the drawback of perhaps overemphasizing the extent to which contemporary institutional science is responsible for knowledge about our world.

For some investigations, such as astronomy and fundamental physics, specialized equipment and training are so essential that such knowledge is the special province of the institution of science. But it wasn’t always so. As noted earlier, astronomical observation occurred across many historical civilizations, such as the Mayan in Central America, Polynesian, and Chinese civilizations. And, even today, scientific research about astronomy, as well as many other topics, sometimes incorporates observations or other contributions from people who aren’t scientists but are just interested in astronomy. This is called participatory research (also citizen science), to be discussed more in Chapter 13.

Some types of scientific research aren’t limited to only people with access to specialized equipment or training. And some types of scientific research relate as much or more to circumstances on the ground in some specific place as to general scientific knowledge. Examples of these kinds of research include investigations of biodiversity in different locations, effective land management techniques, and how specific communities can mitigate the most disastrous effects of climate change on them. For these kinds of scientific research, it’s increasingly appreciated that locals have important expertise and the ability to contribute meaningfully to scientific research.

Beyond the value of localized expertise, it’s also now recognized that traditional societies in many parts of the world have developed extensive stores of knowledge about the natural world around them, some of which are still maintained today. Indigenous knowledge refers to true claims based on observations, practices, and ideas developed about some geographic region by people native to the area. Indigenous knowledge is in part developed with the use of practices crucial to science—observation, systematic recordkeeping, and checking ideas against evidence—but typically outside the institution of science. There is increasing interest in the value of indigenous knowledge within the institution of science, especially about local environmental sustainability and resource use. This becomes only more valuable as scientific research increasingly turns to questions of sustainability and climate change adaptation, as these are shaped by local conditions and the subject of local knowledge.

Although the institution of science aspires to be fully inclusive and international, it inherits a history of exclusion and is still limited in whom it involves. Historically, in the 18th and 19th centuries, sea voyages of European nations played dual roles as both scientific expeditions and also commercial trips to expand colonization. Even today, there are fewer opportunities to become scientists in the Global South (Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania), and scientists in the Global South face more professional challenges in their research. We will discuss diversity in science in greater depth in Chapter 13.

In the context of this chapter’s discussion of how science pursues its aims, this discussion reveals that, though the development of professional science as an institution was very important for its success in uncovering knowledge, it’s also increasingly appreciated that institutional science isn’t the only place where relevant scientific knowledge is found. The scientific value of indigenous knowledge shows that scientific reasoning and scientific knowledge are not the purview of any single culture or institution.

##### EXERCISES

2.18 Recall: Describe two ways in which children’s reasoning is like scientific reasoning and two ways in which scientific reasoning is distinct.

2.19 Recall: Choose one proto-scientific development from the Islamic Golden Age or the Scientific Revolution. Describe how that development constituted progress (a) in the subject matter of science and (b) in the methods of science.

2.20 Think: It was discovered in the 19th century that the planet Mercury was not following the orbit predicted by Newton’s theory of gravity. When this happened, Newton’s theory was not considered falsified. Instead, it was hypothesized that this anomaly was the result of another planet, named Vulcan, orbiting between Mercury and the Sun. Despite a systematic search, Vulcan was never found. The anomalies exhibited by Mercury’s orbit could be explained only a century later by Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity.

1. Why do you think scientists initially refused to consider Newton’s theory falsified?
2. Was this a failure of science? Should the scientists have given up Newton’s theory sooner? Why or why not?
3. Does this mean Newton’s theory of gravity was not falsifiable? Why or why not?

2.21 Recall: Define indigenous knowledge. List three areas of investigation to which indigenous knowledge is particularly relevant and, for each, describe why it’s relevant.

2.22 Apply: Mythology and science are generally understood to be very different from one another. And yet early science had its origins in, and then grew out of, mythology, and both myths and scientific theories provide explanations of the natural and social phenomena observed in the world around us.

1. Look up two creation myths from different cultures and historical periods—that is, myths of how the world began and how people first came to inhabit it.
2. Identify similarities and differences across the two myths.
3. Describe similarities between the creation myths and scientific theories of human origin.
4. Describe differences between the creation myths and scientific theories of human origin.
